The CPU decides which instruction to execute NEXT by reading 
the value of the EIP register and executes the instruction that is
located in that address.

If EIP register contains for instance: 0x77da22ca and that memory
address stores the code: \xff\xe4 [JMP ESP] than the CPU will execute that.

Avoid: \x00 \x0a \x0d

In other words:
The EIP register always contains the address of the next instruction to be executed.
